               Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person — the gift of life.&nbsp; A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated into its components — red cells, platelets and plasma — which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions

               </i>
               <p>Donations are essential for trauma patients and people undergoing a variety of situations, including surgeries, transplants, chronic illnesses, blood disorders and cancer. Because over 90% of people who are eligible to donate do not.</p>

               <p>
                  The entire donation process takes approximately one hour, with about 10 minutes of that time being the actual blood donation. The whole blood donation volume is usually about 500 milliliters, or one pint.

               <p>
                  Donation can be a single, whole blood donation (red cells, plasma and platelets) or an apheresis donation, where one component of blood, such as red cells or platelets, is shared and the other components are returned to the donor. Whole blood donations can be made every eight weeks, up to six times per year.

                  In order to give blood, you’re required to undergo a health screening. A trained staff member performs this checkup. They’ll check your: pulse, blood pressure, body temperature,
                  hemoglobin levels.  It can effectively detect problems that could indicate an underlying medical condition or risk factors for certain diseases.

                  I was enjoying this. After 10min nurse took off the syringe and put a cotton in the area and asked to hold on for 10min. After that she offered me some snacks. And when I came out, Bhaiya asked about experience and then he offered me Tropicana and 4 Raasogulla's. He thanked me for donating blood. There was no sign of weakness after blood donation.

                  I felt elated that yeah I'm not worthless atleast I saved someone's worthy life. I think donating blood is one of the best deed you'll ever come across in your whole life span. You have got the opportunity, it's your chance to become the reason of someone's life and his/her happiness.
